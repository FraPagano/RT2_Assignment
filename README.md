### RT2 Assignment
This repository is an update of the package of the final assignment of the Research Track I course, therefore not only it contains all the files needed for controlling the robot in the simulation environment but also:

 1. A folder named `docs` that contains a software documentation of the project generated with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). You can visit such SW documentation at the following [page](https://frapagano.github.io/RT2_Assignment/). 
 2. A folder named `Jupyter_Notebook` that contains  a User Interface entirely made with Jupyter Notebook. It interacts with the robot and allows the user to visualize data in real time and in an explicit way through animated graphs about laser scan data, odometry and reached/non reached targets.
